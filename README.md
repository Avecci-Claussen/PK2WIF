# PK2WIF
Converting private key to wif segwit / multiple formats

PKallWIF

This Python code converts a given Bitcoin private key to a compressed Wallet Import Format (WIF) for use with Segregated Witness (SegWit) addresses. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

The code uses binascii, ecdsa, hashlib, and base58 libraries.

The convert_privkey_to_WIF_compressed function takes a privkey (the private key) as input and converts it to a compressed WIF format.

It adds a prefix of "80" and a suffix of "01" to the private key (for mainnet).

Two rounds of SHA-256 hashing are applied to the extended private key to obtain checksum bytes.

The checksum is added to the extended key.

The extended key is converted to a base58-encoded WIF format, resulting in a compressed WIF for SegWit addresses.

The code then converts the provided privkey to a compressed WIF and prints the result.


PK2WIF


This Python code converts a given Bitcoin private key to a Wallet Import Format (WIF). Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

The code uses hashlib and base58 libraries.

The private_key variable holds the hexadecimal representation of the private key.

The code adds a prefix of "80" to the private key, indicating that it is a private key.

Two rounds of SHA-256 hashing are applied to the extended private key (extended_key) to obtain a checksum.

The first 4 bytes of the second hash (hash_2) are taken as the checksum.

The checksum is appended to the extended key.

The extended key is converted to base58 encoding, resulting in a WIF format.

The code then prints the WIF representation of the provided private key.
