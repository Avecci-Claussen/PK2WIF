Converting private key to wif segwit / multiple formats


This Python code converts a given Bitcoin private key to a compressed Wallet Import Format (WIF) for use with Segregated Witness (SegWit) addresses. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

The code uses binascii, ecdsa, hashlib, and base58 libraries.

The convert_privkey_to_WIF_compressed function takes a privkey (the private key) as input and converts it to a compressed WIF format.

It adds a prefix of "80" and a suffix of "01" to the private key (for mainnet).

Two rounds of SHA-256 hashing are applied to the extended private key to obtain checksum bytes.

The checksum is added to the extended key.

The extended key is converted to a base58-encoded WIF format, resulting in a compressed WIF for SegWit addresses.

The code then converts the provided privkey to a compressed WIF and prints the result.
